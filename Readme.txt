I've created a complete Python web application for triggering PowerShell scripts with all the features you requested. The application uses Flask as the web framework and has the following key components:
Key Features

Windows Authentication

Uses the win32security module to validate credentials against Windows authentication
Full login and logout functionality


Cascading Dropdown Menus

Three cascading dropdowns (Environment, Activity Type, Version)
Data loaded from a config.json file


Script Management

View button to preview script content
Run button to execute the script asynchronously
Real-time execution status updates


Script Execution

Async execution in a separate thread
Script output saved to scriptname_timestamp.txt in the output folder
Display of execution results including stdout and stderr


Configuration Management

JSON editor for modifying configuration
Save functionality to persist changes


Self-Contained Design

All CSS and JavaScript included in the application
No external calls or dependencies
Following Python project standard structure



Project Structure
/app
  app.py                  - Main application file
  config.json             - Configuration file for dropdowns and script mappings
  /static
    /css
      style.css           - Styling for the application
    /js
      script.js           - Client-side functionality
  /templates
    base.html             - Base template with common elements
    index.html            - Main script runner page
    login.html            - Authentication page
    config_editor.html    - Configuration editing page
  /output                 - Folder for script outputs
  /scripts                - Folder for PowerShell scripts
To run the application:

Install the necessary packages:

pip install flask pywin32

Run the application:

python app.py

Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000

The application follows Python project standards with proper module organization, error handling, and documentation. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, with a clean and modern interface.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet. Claude does not have internet access.
